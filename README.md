# Linux-File-Permissions

Scenario :

You are a security professional at a large organization. You mainly work with their research team. Part of your job is to ensure users on this team are authorized with the appropriate permissions. This helps keep the system secure. 

Your task is to examine existing permissions on the file system. You’ll need to determine if the permissions match the authorization that should be given. If they do not match, you’ll need to modify the permissions to authorize the appropriate users and remove any unauthorized access.

The organization does not allow others to have write access to any files. Based on the permissions established,  identify which file needs to have its permissions modified. Use a Linux command to modify these permissions.

The research team has archived .project_x.txt, which is why it’s a hidden file. This file should not have write permissions for anyone, but the user and group should be able to read the file. Use a Linux command to assign .project_x.txt the appropriate authorization.

The files and directories in the projects directory belong to the researcher2 user. Only researcher2 should be allowed to access the drafts directory and its contents. Use a Linux command to modify the permissions accordingly.

To finalize the document and make its purpose clear, add Project description and Summary sections of the File permissions in Linux template. 

In the Project description section, give a general overview of the scenario and what you accomplish through Linux. Write two to four sentences.

In the Summary section, provide a short summary of the previous tasks and connect them to the scenario. Write approximately two to four sentences.
